I'm a Senior Software Developer with a focus on DevOps and Infrastructure as Code. With over 9 years of experience in software development and cloud operations, I specialize in designing elegant automation solutions that simplify complex problems.

My expertise spans Azure cloud environments, Terraform automation, and CI/CD pipeline implementation using Azure DevOps. At Dayforce, I helped develop and support the Microservice Delivery Platform (MDP) that streamlines code deployment to the cloud, making delivery faster and more reliable for development teams.

I excel at creating frameworks and tools that reduce manual effort, optimize cloud resource usage, and improve development workflows. My background in cloud operations gives me valuable perspective on building maintainable systems that perform well in production.

I'm passionate about:

 Building scalable automation solutions
 Optimizing cloud infrastructure and costs
 Streamlining deployment processes
 Creating developer tools that boost productivity

My technical toolkit includes C#, PowerShell, YAML, Terraform, Azure cloud services, and CI/CD pipeline design. I hold Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification and continuously expand my cloud and DevOps expertise.
